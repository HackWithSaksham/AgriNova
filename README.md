KisanConnect - A Platform where fair prices meet fair trades among rural vendors and customers.

KisanConnect is a rural E-Marketplace designed to empower local vendors, farmers, and small businesses by giving them a direct platform to connect with buyers. Instead of relying on middlemen, this project aims to make trading simpler, fairer and more accessible for rural communities.

At Team AgriNova, our vision is to bring about a change where farmers and rural entrepreneurs can showcase their products online, receiver fair prices, and access a wider customer base. By combining technology with everyday needs, we hope to make rural commerce more sustainable and transparent.
